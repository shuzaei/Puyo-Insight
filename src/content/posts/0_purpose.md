# Purpose of This Blog

## Preface

Puyo is a puzzle game where the player matches four or more Puyos of the same color to clear them from the screen. (Note: "Puyo Puyo" is a registered trademark of SEGA now 2024, and we will distinguish it from the general term "Puyo" in this blog.) There are many different regulations and rules for Puyo, but in this blog, we will focus on the rules of so-called "Puyo Tsu" used in popular titles such as "Puyo Puyo Legends".

## Target Readers

This blog is for anyone who wants to learn everything about Puyo, from the basics to the advanced strategies. We will focus especially on the "game" aspect of Puyo, and discuss how we can construct a strategy to win the game. So we will not cover specific things like the history of Puyo or how to install the game, and not set specific levels of the target readers. Maybe we will add some tags to categorize the difficulty of the content.
